## Credits

Starter code was provided for refactoring as part of the Rutgers Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp.

ChatGPT was consulted. While nothing was directly copied from ChatGPT, I still want to credit the LLM for its assistance solving problems and occasionally acting as a second set of eyes to find a typo in a snippet of code. Also for helping me spell occasionally just now.
